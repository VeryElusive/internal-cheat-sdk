I was going to create a CS2 hvh cheat, but I felt there was no point seeing as valve has destroyed what has made hvh fun; DESYNC

Here is the base I was making. It has the entire cheat base ready, including a menu. Valve SDK has not been implemented very far.

wreakhavoc.online is still going to live on, for kernel cheats in other games such as rust.
